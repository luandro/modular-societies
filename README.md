## Introduction

Through meditation and similar practices, one can for brief moments become external to himself. And by doing this, he can in turn ponder about aspects of himself that would otherwise have been hidden.

In a similar way, once you become external to your own society and venture to isolated communities, patterns of social behaviors and techniques emerge. The contrast between community and individualistic social lifestyles makes possible to analyze through both perspectives how economics, politics and communications have development in the contemporary world.

This essay will try identify patterns and guidelines that could be useful for the creation and sustenance of modular societies.

## Bases

Ideally societies should have come to exist from common needs that would be more easily solved from combining efforts of many groups of people. Unfortunately as history tells us, it was less about choice and more about force.
